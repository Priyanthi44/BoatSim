Autonomous Boat Simulator implemented in MatLab (2013).
Run BoatSim.m in the Command Window to begin.

Adjust parameters and functions in any of the Config_* files to vary:
- animation viewing window...
- dynamics time step, duration, initial conditions...
- boat inertia, thruster placement and motor models...
- environmental force models and gains...
- robot's decision procedure, controller, state estimator...

COMPLETE:
- single body dynamics engine
- high-speed mode with plots
- realtime mode with 3D animation
- gravity, buoyancy, and drag models
- robot class designed for easy but general idea testing

INCOMPLETE:
- good documentation
- user interface for realtime input
- camera follows the boat during 3D animation
- thruster models
- wind and wave models
- multibody support with collision detection
- 2D animation mode

This program may never be completed because #python.

Intended for use by PropaGator2 of the Machine Intelligence Lab at the University of Florida.
